### Rails Week Convo
* didn't feel better about self or code
* powerful with generator, but not more fun
* same file structure
* modern companies still using Rails
* active record is great

### MVC
* Model - data abstraction layer
* View - templating => HTML page, helper functions
* Controller - brains of the operation
